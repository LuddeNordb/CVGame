# Hiring Game

**Hiring Game** is a lighthearted, fast-paced party game for 3 or more players where you compete to get your candidate hired as CEO!

Each round, players receive a new, often ridiculous job description and select from a hand of quirky, confusing CVs to present the "best" candidate. After some lively pitching, the temporary CEO picks who to hire — but with the strange resumes and tasks, it’s not always easy to tell who’s the right fit!

Score points by getting your candidate hired. First to reach the winning score takes the crown!
